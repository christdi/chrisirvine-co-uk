   A look into my process of defining the minimum viable product and user stories for my new side project.

The first stage in getting my new project off the ground the Right Way™ is to define my goal.  Like most things agile, iteration is key, so let’s start with the most basic idea.

> “Create a game with a new MUD engine”.

That’s all well and good but there’s a bit of a problem.  I don’t just want to write a game, I want to write a game that’ll actually attract some players! MUDs have seen a major decline in player bases since the rise of the MMO but I think it’s still possible to be relatively successful in the right circumstances.

  * It has to be accessible.  There’s a huge gamer base out there who are not going to know what a MUD is or have any idea how to connect to it.  

  * It has to be engaging.  Players have to be introduced to core gameplay mechanics and they need to be enjoyable.  We want to quickly establish a positive feedback loop.
  
  * It has to be single player.
