   The first in a series of articles which takes a look at why some developers, myself included, struggle to make real headway on our side projects.


   I'll be exploring the reasons why I believe I've failed in the past, the steps I'm taking to to help and the progress I make along the way.

I’ve been a Software Developer for over a decade now.  I’ve written feature after feature, done release after release, it’s my bread and butter.  Despite that I’ve never once managed to get a side project to a level where I was happy to release it to the world and I’d really like to.

So what’s the difference? I took a minute to introspect and came up with the following.

  * I don’t plan what I want to implement.  I start with a vague idea and just start writing code because it’s more fun!  Akin to those monkeys writing Shakespeare, this rarely works out.

  * I abandon the project, maybe I think there’s nothing to be gained from it, nothing to be learned or no commercial viability.
  
  * I get pulled away from it, life gets in the way.  When I get back to the project I have no idea what I was doing or planning to do.

With that in mind, I’m going to take another shot at a side project I’ve attempted a few times in the past.  I’m going to write a MUD (multi user dungeon) engine and implement a game using it.

Clearly my current approach isn’t working.  So I’m going to make a few changes.

  * I’m going to bring in some project management.  I’ll make use of Github issues and the project board to track progress.  Ideally this will mean even if I have to leave the project for a while, I can come back and see where things stand.

  * I’m going to use some agile methodology to spec out the work.  I’m going to identify what’ll make up a minimum viable product, capture that as user stories and make sure we’ve got some acceptance criteria.  This is to help focus my development efforts towards concrete features rather than just writing code and seeing what happens.

  * I’m going to write tests.  Don’t worry! I already do professionally but they’re nowhere to be seen in my side projects.  That has to change, I know their value.  I’m unlikely to follow full blown TDD, but the hope is that having tests will inform the overall design of the application making it more maintainable.

  * I’m going to blog, stream and upload videos of my progress.  The project itself isn’t ground breaking, however I hope by documenting my attempts in changing my progress I can share my success (or failure!) and perhaps it’ll be useful for other developers who find themselves in the same position.
