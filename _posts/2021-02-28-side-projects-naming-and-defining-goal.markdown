   This article looks into one of the most difficult task in software development; naming something.
   

   We'll also take a look into defining a goal to capture what we want to accomplish with our new project.

I'm going to use the name "Covenstead" for the side project going forward.  It's a setting that I was involved in creating for a past swing at this that actually got pretty far along.  I'm going to re-use it as I really liked the setting.  More on that in future articles.

The first stage in getting our new project off the ground the Right Way™ is to define our goal.  Let’s start with the most basic idea and then try to evolve it into something a bit more specific.

> “Let’s create a game with a new MUD engine”.

That’s all well and good but there’s a bit of a problem.  We don’t just want to write a game, We want to write a game that’ll actually attract and retain some players! MUDs have seen a major decline in player bases since the rise of the MMO but I think it’s still possible to be relatively successful in the right circumstances.

  * It has to be accessible.  Most gamers won’t even know what a MUD is nevermind how to connect to one.  We need to streamline the process so that it's in line with what people already know.  We’ll also need a nice UI/UX, plain text isn’t going to cut it. 

  * It has to be engaging.  Players have to be introduced early to core gameplay mechanics and they need to be enjoyable.  We want to quickly establish a positive feedback loop that'll make players want to continue playing.  We also need a story that the player can participate in to immerse them into the world.
 
  * It has to be designed primarily for a single player experience.  We can't rely on the traditional D&D/ style group play as we have no guarantee of numbers.  So to make it as accessible as we can, we should design our content around a solo player with optional or scalable group content.

  * It has to be branded correctly.  As stated earlier, players don’t really know what a MUD is anymore and there’s no real advantage in trying to educate the player.  So let’s go with a different branding to describe itself.  Maybe keeping it simple with, “browser based online RPG?”, assuming of course we’re going to offer a browser interface.

So let’s refine our original goal.

> “Let’s create an accessible, engaging story driven online single player RPG with optional collaborative gameplay inspired by traditional MUDs”

It’s a bit overly formal but it’s better to lean towards more specific as it helps constrain what we actually need to create to make it a reality.  With that done, our next stop is defining some user stories.
