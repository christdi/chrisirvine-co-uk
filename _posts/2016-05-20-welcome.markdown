The repository of any thoughts I’d like to share with the world.

This site was created with a static site generator tool named [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  After several iterations of this site from basic HTML to full-on Angular, this was a good compromise between function and actual ease of updating. 

The default aesthetic is also fairly minimal which suits my tastes just fine.

I doubt I’ll post often, but hopefully if you’re here, the content is of at least some interest to you.
